# Elon_JrSo_2022-23

Thanks, Karyn. Excited to review the updated messages.

My feedback is:

Message
- replace "roll up your sleeves..." with "experiential learning is our defining feature, (name)"
- replace "boundless" with "meaningful" (or "intentional")

PURL
- replace "no limits to the" with "numerous"

ES

Make it happen

From engineering design to advance prototyping, mechatronics and virtual reality, Elon’s Innovation Quad has multiple labs to design, experiment and create.

Because the photo is someone playing a 3D guitar, please change to:

Finally, please switch the photo of the blue-haired girl with the other blue-haired girl that I sent. I've reattached it for your convenience.



Moving forward, we (Elon) will discuss text/photo changes amongst ourselves and then I will provide the changes to you in an effort to be more efficient, reduce the number of emails and to minimize confusion.



Thanks!
